# Gameplay
Currently, the game can support up to four players. Players (represented by squares), can roll the dice by clicking the Roll Dice button in the top left corner of the screen, and move around the board. Spaces will display their names when landed on, and property spaces will allow the player to either buy or pass. Players will also receive a $200 salary when landing on or passing Go, and a bonus when landing on Free Parking (top left corner space). To end a player's turn and move to the next player's turn, the Next Turn button can be pressed.
